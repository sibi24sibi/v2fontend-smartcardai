    "    <h2>Specific Heat Relationships for Ideal Gases</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Specific heat relationships describe the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of an ideal gas by a certain amount.</p>\n",
    "    <h3>Specific Heat at Constant Volume (c<sub>v</sub>)</h3>\n",
    "    <p>The specific heat at constant volume (c<sub>v</sub>) represents the change in internal energy (<em>u</em>) per unit mass (<em>m</em>) per degree Celsius change in temperature (ΔT) at constant volume (V).</p>\n",
    "    <p>We can express it mathematically as:</p>\n",
    "    <p>$$c_v = \\\\frac{\\\\delta u}{m \\\\delta T}_V$$</p>\n",
    "    <h3>Specific Heat at Constant Pressure (c<sub>p</sub>)</h3>\n",
    "    <p>The specific heat at constant pressure (c<sub>p</sub>) represents the change in enthalpy (<em>h</em>) per unit mass (<em>m</em>) per degree Celsius change in temperature (ΔT) at constant pressure (P).</p>\n",
    "    <p>The formula for c<sub>p</sub> is:</p>\n",
    "    <p>$$c_p = \\\\frac{\\\\delta h}{m \\\\delta T}_P$$</p>\n",
    "    <h3>Relationship between c<sub>p</sub> and c<sub>v</sub></h3>\n",
    "    <p>For ideal gases, there's a specific relationship between c<sub>p</sub> and c<sub>v</sub>. The difference between them is equal to the gas constant (<em>R</em>).</p>\n",
    "    <p>This relationship is expressed as:</p>\n",
    "    <p>$$c_p = c_v + R$$</p>\n",
    "    <h3>Key Points</h3>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Internal Energy (<em>u</em>):</strong> The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature.</li>\n",
    "      <li>The change in internal energy (Δu) can be calculated as the integral of c<sub>v</sub> over the temperature change: Δu = ∫c<sub>v</sub>dT</li>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Enthalpy (<em>h</em>):</strong> Enthalpy represents the total energy of a system, including both internal energy and the energy associated with pressure-volume work.</li>\n",
    "      <li>The change in enthalpy (Δh) can be calculated as the integral of c<sub>p</sub> over the temperature change: Δh = ∫c<sub>p</sub>dT</li>\n",
    "      <li><strong>Approximations:</strong> Over small temperature intervals, c<sub>p</sub> and c<sub>v</sub> can be approximated as constant values (C<sub>avg</sub>). This simplifies calculations.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <p>Feel free to ask if you'd like a deeper explanation of any concept or applications of these relationships!</p>\n",
